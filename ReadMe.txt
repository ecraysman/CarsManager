Personal Comments:
I would have loved to make 100% of the requeriments before the deadline, but I couldn't.
"Current Work" was chaotic, and I haven't been able to dedicate enough time to finish.

Considering that the deadline is fixed, I'm sending the uncomplete version, just in case.

Altought I consider this is the best code under the circumpstances, I'll be thrilled if we can discuss this in person
or if the deadline can be extended.

What is missing:
-> Debugging the Users Generation (Delete is not working)
-> Implementing Authentication
-> Generating Unit Tests

What could be improved:
-> Abstraction of the business rules (interfaces)
-> Naming of Files => I'm not happy with the results.
-> Namespaces usage => Ended up being too confusing, due to the short timeframe.








Startup Instructions:

1. run docker => docker compose up
2. run init script => db-init.sql => Load it using heidiSQL or another tool
//ToDo: attach the init scripto to docker configuration and eliminate step #2
3. Make sure startup project is API
4. Run => IIS Express or Docker
5. Create User
6. Authenticate (not Implemented Yet)
7. Create Car
8. Test & Evaluate => As a personal favor, regardless of the evaluation result, please take 5 minutes to send me back your feedback.
Even if the evaluation is negative, it will help me improve for other opportunities.

Thanks!
